============

Search tool for JavaScript [components](https://github.com/component/guide).

This is **experimental testing version** of proposal for new site design for the <http://component.io> searchable repository. The design was created as [Nipster](https://github.com/eirikb/nipster)-clone
modified to work with [Component Crawler](https://github.com/component/crawler.js) as data source.
